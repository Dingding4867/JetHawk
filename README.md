Code on Jetson Nano and Pixhawk to direct vehicle to waypoints

Jan 9, 2024

 The Jetson Nano computes the course to the next waypoint and communicates that information over a CAN
 link to the Drive-By-Wire computer.

 Initial version follows a straight line; future versions will keep it on the pavement.
 Future versions will have the Jetson Nano detect obstacles and plot a way around them.
